# Sysmon-Threat-Detection
Detecting unauthorized activity using Sysmon and Windows Event Viewer
Objective:
	This project demonstrates how Sysmon can help detect unauthorized user activity particularly network connections and process executiona tracking. By leveraging Sysmonâ€™s detailed logging capabilities, security teams can identify suspicious activity before it escalates into a security incident.

Tools Used: 
  -Sysmon (configured with the SwitftOnSecurity Sysmon config)
  -Windows Event Viewer

Project Steps and Findings:
  -Sysmon Installation and Configuration
  -Installed Sysmon and applied the SwiftOnSecurity config to expand event tracking beyond basic process creation and termination.
  -Process Execution and Network Monitoring
    -Ran the following commands to generate logs
      -Curl (to test outbound network requests)
      -Whoami (to check user identity)
      -Ping (to simulate network activity)
    -Observed Sysmon Event Logs
      -Event ID 1 (Process Create): Captured PowerShell executions, including full command-line arguments.

      -Event ID 3 (Network Connection Detection): Logged outbound network connections initiated by executed processes.

File Creation Monitoring
  -Created test files to observe file activity tracking
    -Event ID 11 (FileCreate): Logged new file creations, helping detect unauthorized file modifications.

Registry Modification Monitoring
  -Modified the Window registry to test detection.
    -Event ID 13 (Registry Value Set): Captured changes to registry keys: a common attack vector for persistence tactics.

Key Takeaways and Next Steps
  -Sysmon effectively tracks process execution, network connections, file creation, and registry changes, making it a powerful tool for malware detection, unauthorized access monitoring, and insider threat identification.
  -Next Step:
    -The next step for a Security team would be to forward the Sysmon logs to Microsoft Sentinel for a real time alerting and correlation, improving security visibility through a single-pane-of-glass. This is what's known as a SIEM or Security Information and Event Management System.
